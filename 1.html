  <center><p>Cyber Square is a unique online learning platform for students and teachers
        that teaches Coding, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and the Internet of
        Things (IoT) at schools. The training, mentorship, and support can be
        extended to one-on-one sessions for the kids too. So, the parents who wish to
        provide their children with the fun learning courses that suit them can do that
        as well through our platform. We use the most engaging methods like games,
        puzzles, etc to educate kids about the latest technologies. Our vision is to
        educate the children about the latest & upcoming technologies so that they're
        prepared for the changes that are going to happen in the near future. Our
        collaboration with schools that follow CBSE and British curriculum is to
        provide & support the schools with a well-structured, expert-designed
        curriculum to complement their Computer Subject curriculum. This also
        includes organizing regular digital fests, promoting coding clubs at the
        school, and preparing the students at times of national & international
        competitions, and more.</p></center>
